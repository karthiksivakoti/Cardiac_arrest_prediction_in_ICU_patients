## üß¨ Key Components

### Data Pipeline
- Extracts clinical data from MIMIC-III database
- Identifies cardiac arrest cases using ICD-9 codes
- Joins patient demographics, vital signs, and laboratory values
- Handles missing data with domain-appropriate strategies
- Normalizes and scales features for optimal model performance

### Random Forest Model (Baseline)
- Provides excellent interpretability and baseline performance
- Identifies key predictors including arrhythmia, glucose levels, and length of stay
- Achieves good balance of precision and recall
- Used as the primary model (70% weight) in the ensemble

### Deep Learning Model
- Multi-layer neural network with regularization techniques
- Leverages non-linear patterns in the data
- Incorporates batch normalization and dropout layers
- Uses focal loss to address class imbalance
- Complementary model (30% weight) in the ensemble

### Risk Calculator
- Generates intuitive 0-100 risk scores tied to probability
- Provides granular risk levels (Very Low to Critical)
- Identifies key contributing factors for individual predictions
- Delivers tailored clinical recommendations based on specific risk factors
- Adapts to available patient data (works with partial information)

## üìà Clinical Impact

The cardiac arrest prediction system offers several key clinical benefits:

- **Early Warning System**: Identifies at-risk patients before deterioration
- **Resource Optimization**: Directs monitoring resources to highest-risk patients
- **Personalized Care**: Tailors recommendations to specific patient risk factors
- **Decision Support**: Provides evidence-based guidance for clinical teams
- **Risk Communication**: Facilitates clear communication of patient status

## üè• Sample Risk Profiles

The system provides detailed risk assessments for patients across the risk spectrum:

### Low Risk Patient
- **Risk Score**: 30/100
- **Risk Level**: Moderate
- **Key Factors**: Elevated glucose levels
- **Recommendations**: Increased monitoring frequency, consider telemetry, cardiology consultation

### Moderate Risk Patient
- **Risk Score**: 52/100
- **Risk Level**: High
- **Key Factors**: History of arrhythmia, elevated glucose levels
- **Recommendations**: Continuous cardiac monitoring, urgent cardiology consultation, electrolyte evaluation

### High Risk Patient
- **Risk Score**: 56/100
- **Risk Level**: High
- **Key Factors**: Arrhythmia, elevated glucose, low blood pressure
- **Recommendations**: ICU consideration, cardiology consultation, fluid management assessment

### Critical Risk Patient
- **Risk Score**: 63/100
- **Risk Level**: Very High
- **Key Factors**: Arrhythmia, elevated glucose, low SpO2, elevated respiratory rate
- **Recommendations**: ICU admission, continuous monitoring, urgent interventions, resuscitation preparation
